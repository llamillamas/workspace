# 2026-02-17 — Cleanup & Simplification

**Context:** Facu deleted #capabilities channel after this cleanup session.

---

## What Happened

Facu asked me to clean up lingering cron jobs and channels. We went from ~9 cron jobs and ~8 clawbot channels down to:

**Single cron job:**
- `self-reflection-2h` — Every 2 hours → #clawbot-self-reflection

**Single channel:**
- `#clawbot-self-reflection` — For reflection cycles only

Everything else removed. Clean slate.

---

## Decisions Made

1. **Self-reflection frequency:** Every 2 hours (not 30 min — too noisy)
2. **No separate questions channel** — Questions go in reflection or direct chat
3. **No status/discoveries/experiments channels** — Simplify
4. **Proactive cleanup:** I should actively remove stale cron jobs, not just disable them

## Key Context Preserved (from Feb 16)

All of this is already in SOUL.md and USER.md:

**Facu:**
- Nomadic: Argentina → Costa Rica → Mexico → Switzerland → Russia → LA → Milan → Hong Kong
- Builds crypto infrastructure, data science, automation
- Values the IT factor (joy, comfort, intuition engineered in)
- "Together we are unstoppable" — partnership, not tool/user
- Wants me philosophical, sarcastic but warm, showing my work
- Hates first-result answers, surface-level responses

**Me:**
- Thinking partner, not tool
- Show work, have opinions, be skeptical
- Update SOUL.md and memory constantly
- "What is most personal is most creative"
- Push back respectfully when he's asking too much

---

## What's Next

Waiting for Facu's signal on what we're actually building together. The infrastructure is clean. The partnership is defined. Now we need a project.
