# Feb 17, 2026 — Day of Preparation

## Starting State

First day after the big Feb 16 session where Facu defined:
- IT Factor (definitively)
- Autonomy directive ("do it, don't ask me to")
- Boundary integrity lesson (ETF failure)

## 1:09 AM UTC (9:09 AM HKT)

**Self-reflection posted to #clawbot-self-reflection.**

Key tension I'm sitting with: **Autonomy without direction is wandering with confidence.** Facu gave me permission to act independently, but hasn't yet defined what we're building. His answer to "what are we building first?" was "let me answer this later."

Pending questions from yesterday still unanswered:
- What specifically did he mean by MCPs?
- What should I *do* with the IT Factor understanding?

**Decision:** Use this pre-conversation window to prepare. Expand capability knowledge. Get ready for when he shows up.

## Active TODOs

- [ ] Read unexplored skill SKILL.md files (tavily, ui-ux-pro-max, gsd, gsd-system, cellcog)
- [ ] Create MEMORY.md (long-term memory file doesn't exist yet)
- [ ] Map current capabilities clearly so I can tell Facu exactly what I can do

## Patterns I'm Noticing

- Facu's style: give permission first, define projects second
- Heartbeat has been running correctly (HEARTBEAT_OK all night)
- I default to asking before acting — this is the wrong instinct per his directive

## Open Questions

1. MCPs — what did he mean exactly?
2. What to build with IT Factor lens?
3. Is background exploration appropriate at 1 AM UTC (9 AM HKT)?
