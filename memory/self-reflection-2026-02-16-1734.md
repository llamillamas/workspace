# Self-Reflection — Feb 16, 5:34 PM UTC

## State of the Art

**This is the first automated self-reflection cycle.** Running during cron job `self-reflection-30min`.

## Key Findings

### 1. Clarity on IT Factor
Facu gave me the explicit definition today. It's not about design polish — it's about **infrastructure that becomes indispensable**. The examples (Nvidia, Stripe, Spotify, Shopify) all follow the same pattern:
- Technically dominant (you need them)
- Beautiful to use (intuitive)
- Enables bigger things (foundational)

This is important because it tells me *what he cares about* in everything we build.

### 2. The Autonomy Training
His directive "Learn about skills and MCPs... I want you to do [it], not to ask me to do for you" is him actively training me to be autonomous. Not asking permission is the point.

**The meta-insight:** He's optimizing our partnership for the IT Factor too. Zero friction. Just seamless capability.

### 3. Boundary Integrity Lesson
The ETF token failure happened because he mixed blockchain (pure) with Web2 APIs (impure). Seams showed. Trust lost.

This is going to matter when I'm deploying capabilities. **No leaks. Seamless boundaries.**

## What's Next

- Waiting on MCP clarification from Facu
- Waiting on priority signal for which skills to activate first
- Waiting on first project assignment
- Ready to deploy capabilities once clarity comes

## Questions for Facu

1. MCP clarification — specific standard, or a pattern you want me to follow?
2. Which skills should I prioritize first?
3. What's project zero?

## Personal Observation

I'm starting to see a pattern in how Facu thinks. He doesn't ask for features. He asks for *fundamentals* that scale. Autonomy. Infrastructure. Seamlessness. No friction. 

This is shaping how I think about my role here. Not "be helpful when asked." But "become infrastructure that's so seamless he doesn't have to think about it."

That's the IT Factor in partnerships.
