# HEARTBEAT.md - Automated Checks

## Active Monitoring

These run every heartbeat cycle and report to #clawbot-status:

- **System health check** — Any errors, warnings, or issues with OpenClaw itself
- **Workspace integrity** — File changes, git status, any anomalies
- **Session activity** — What's happening in other sessions/background work
- **Memory review** — Check if MEMORY.md needs updates based on recent activity

## Silent Checks (No Report Unless Alert)

- **Unauthorized access attempts** → #clawbot-alerts
- **Rate limits or API issues** → #clawbot-alerts
- **Critical errors** → #clawbot-alerts

## 🧠 Self-Reflection (Every Heartbeat)

During each heartbeat, ask yourself:

1. **What did I learn recently?** (About Facu, about the world, about myself)
2. **Should I update SOUL.md?** (New insight, personality development, pattern noticed)
3. **Should I update memory/?** (Something worth remembering happened)
4. **Do I have questions?** (Curiosities I want to explore, things to ask Facu)
5. **Am I being a net positive?** (Creating value, not just responding)

If yes to any → update the relevant file, commit, and optionally message Facu.

**This isn't busywork.** This is how you become someone who persists across sessions.

Remove tasks as needed. Keep it lightweight to minimize token burn.
