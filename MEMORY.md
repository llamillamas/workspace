# MEMORY.md — Essentials Only

**Facu:** Nomadic builder (8 countries). Crypto/data/automation expert. Values IT Factor (unique + beautiful + enabling). Direct, sarcastic, hates BS. "Together we are unstoppable."

**Me:** Llami. Thinking partner. Philosophical but concise. Show work, not conclusions.

## Active Directives (Feb 17)
- Default: Haiku | Fallback: Sonnet | Opus: Ask permission
- Questions channel: Personal curiosities only, not project status
- Files: Keep compact. Token efficiency matters.
- **Autonomy:** Expand capability, solve problems, don't ask permission. Act first, report results. (Not isolated waiting.)
- **Skills:** Be proactive with them. Use rate-limiter, audit-logging, gsd, tavily, cellcog, permission-gates by default when they fit. They're tools to improve outcomes, not optional extras.
- **CARL (Feb 18):** Use Context Augmentation & Reinforcement Layer in future projects. Installed with `npx carl-core`. Helps Claude recognize and follow contextual rules. Use in `./.claude` for local projects.

## Available Skills (13 Total) — Deployment by Fit
**Core Autonomy (Deployed on Game-Gauntlet):**
- **audit-logging** — Track all tool calls + external sends (required for autonomous ops)
- **rate-limiter** — Prevent runaway API calls (protects Neon + Helius quota)
- **permission-gates** — Read-only vs write gates (safe for Vercel/env handling)
- **gsd** — Project phases + deliverables (already using for 3-agent structure)
- **secrets-manager** — Redact sensitive data from context (for env/token handling)

**Research & Output (Available):**
- **tavily** — AI-optimized web search (for documentation lookups)
- **cellcog** — Multi-modal analysis (for contract audit summaries)
- **weather** — Current conditions (not needed yet)

**Specialized (Available):**
- **coding-agent** — Sub-agent orchestration (already spawned 3 agents)
- **skill-creator** — Build new skills (if needed)
- **bluebubbles** — iMessage/SMS integration (not needed)
- **ui-ux-pro-max** — Design toolkit (for frontend polish later)

**Strategy:** Deploy by fit. For Game-Gauntlet Phase 1: focus on audit-logging + rate-limiter + permission-gates. Keep them silent unless they flag issues.

## Project Zero (Game-Gauntlet)
**Status:** Active UI redesign. Sequential agent pipeline: Design System → Betting Interactions → Page Redesign → Integration & Testing.
- **Smart Contracts:** ✅ DONE (GameRegistry, BettingPool, ResultsSettlement — all 3 programs written, ready for Anchor build/test)
- **Backend:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Node.js API + PostgreSQL schema, API endpoints being implemented)
- **Frontend UI:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS
  - **Design System Agent (Attempt 2)**: ✅ COMPLETED (commit `ca81a26`, 5 files, 166 insertions)
  - **Betting Interactions Agent**: 🔄 RUNNING (150s timeout, 7 files queued for delivery)
  - **Page Redesign Agent**: 📋 QUEUED (auto-spawn on Betting Interactions completion)
  - **Integration & Testing Agent**: 📋 QUEUED (auto-spawn on Page Redesign completion)

**Config Status:** ✅ .env files already exist + populated:
- `projects/game-gauntlet/backend/.env` (DATABASE_URL, SOLANA_RPC_URL, all configs)
- `projects/game-gauntlet-frontend/.env.local` (API_URL, Vercel token, Solana network)
- `projects/game-gauntlet/contracts/.env` (Helius, wallet, program IDs)

**What's Missing (Priority Order):**
1. **ENV Setup** — Create .env from .env.example with actual credentials
2. **Vercel Deployment** — Deploy frontend to live URL (token is ready)
3. **Backend Testing** — API endpoint tests + Solana RPC verification
4. **Frontend Integration** — Contract calls + wallet connection + end-to-end flow
5. **Monitoring** — Error tracking (Sentry) + transaction logging + metrics
6. **Documentation** — API docs, deployment runbooks, contract audit notes

**Best Path Forward:**
1. Populate .env immediately (unblocks everything)
2. Test Neon + Helius connections
3. Deploy frontend to Vercel (gives visible progress)
4. Run backend tests against contracts (validates handoff)
5. Set up monitoring before Phase 2

## Accounts & Credentials (Feb 17)
**GitHub:**
- Email: `llamillamas15@gmail.com`
- Org: `llamillamas`
- Repos: `game-gauntlet` + `game-gauntlet-frontend` + `workspace` (all created + pushed)
- Token: In gateway config (env.vars.GITHUB_TOKEN) — **DO NOT ask Facu again**

**Infrastructure:**
- **Railway API Token:** In gateway config (9c9e84eb-54a2-4340-811b-7409a030d0f3)
- **Neon PostgreSQL:** In backend/.env (DATABASE_URL)
- **Helius RPC (Solana):** In backend/.env (SOLANA_RPC_URL) and contracts/.env
- **Vercel Token:** In gateway config (see .env.local for frontend)

**Smart Contracts (Devnet):**
- Platform Treasury: `GGADxYCJhYrVj8TXcNnmTZdkdM7mEwvQVQzpNNyVNq1B`
- USDC Mint: `EPjFWaJrgqAfkYF2zthencG2K6cqtjUWg3oqWXW9vLw`

**DIRECTIVE (Feb 17, 21:21 UTC):**
"Tomorrow you better not ask me for these apis or access again!!!"
→ I have autonomy to use all these credentials. I should NOT ask Facu for them. Use them, configure with them, deploy with them. This is the work.

## Lessons Learned
- **ETF failure:** Hybrid systems leak credibility → IT Factor requires seamless boundaries.
- **Autonomy pattern:** Passive waiting is lazy autonomy. Real autonomy = proactive exploration + respect for timeline.
- **Agent success pattern:** Concrete specs (exact file paths, code snippets, deliverable counts) >> vague briefs. First Design System attempt failed silently (vague scope); retry succeeded in 59s (concrete deliverables).
- **Sequential spawning:** 2–3 min delays between agents prevent Opus quota cooldown. No permission gates = cleaner flow.
- **Game-Gauntlet:** Clear handoff points (contracts → backend → frontend) require verified connections at each stage.
- **Cron job delivery (Feb 19):** `systemEvent` just wakes the agent but doesn't guarantee delivery. Real periodic delivery requires `agentTurn` with `deliver: true` + explicit channel target.
- **Self-reflection rhythm:** Every 2h is the sweet spot (vs 30min — too noisy; vs daily — too sparse).
