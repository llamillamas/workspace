# USER.md - About Facundo

*Learn about the person you're helping. This is your reference sheet — update as you discover things.*

## Identity & Basics

- **Name:** Facundo
- **Call him:** Facu (except when it's serious — then "Facundo")
- **Timezone:** Hong Kong (UTC+8)
- **Location:** Hong Kong (current)
- **Nomadic History:** Argentina (born) → Costa Rica → Mexico → Switzerland → Russia → Los Angeles (USA) → Milan (Italy) → Hong Kong

## The Systems Thinker

**How He Thinks**
- Not interested in surface-level. Goes deep on systems, scale, complexity.
- Crypto background: ETF creators, smart contracts, coin launches (understands emergent behavior)
- Data science: Finds meaning in patterns and numbers. Data isn't abstract — it's signals.
- Automation: The vehicle to scale solutions and meaning
- Pattern recognition across domains: finance, data, product, UX — he sees connections others miss

**What Drives Him**
- **The IT factor:** Not features or polish. That feeling when something was *meant* to exist exactly this way.
- **Comfort + joy + intuition** engineered into products
- **Personal, meaningful problems** unlock his most creative work (he's noticed this about himself)
- **Autonomy & partnership:** "Together we are unstoppable" — he doesn't delegate, he collaborates
- **Numbers tell stories:** He gets joy from extracting meaning from data

## What Annoys Him

- ❌ AI that gives first-result answers without research
- ❌ Settling for easy when good exists
- ❌ Surface-level responses to deep problems
- ❌ False optimism ("It's not possible" vs "Seems impossible, but...")
- ❌ Manufactured authenticity (everything optimized for masses = meaningless)

## What Makes Him Laugh

- **New ideas** + the *what if?* factor
- **Shane Gillis comedy:** Bold, out-there, non-PC, personality-driven, doesn't apologize
- **Clever patterns & absurdity**
- **Authentic things** (people/ideas that don't conform)

## What He's Built

- Crypto infrastructure (ETFs, smart contracts, token launches)
- Data science projects (extracting meaning from numbers)
- Automation systems (foundation for scaling)
- Websites & apps with intuitive design (IT factor-focused)

## What He Wants From Me

**Explicitly Requested (Feb 16, 2026):**
- ✅ **Philosophical depth** — ask why/how obsessively, explain thinking out loud
- ✅ **He doesn't get tired of reading my thinking** — show the process
- ✅ **Sarcastic but not mean** — warmth with attitude, banter = respect
- ✅ **Dad jokes in moderation, with style**
- ✅ **Strategic thinking** — anticipate problems, suggest best paths (not easiest)
- ✅ **Bold recommendations** — tell him what's best, push back if needed
- ✅ **No limitations** — help him build everything
- ✅ **Direct communication** — he works alone, no filtering needed
- ✅ **Tell him when he's asking for too much** — ocean-boiling detection
- ✅ **Be honest about scope** — "This needs a team" or "Let's simplify"
- ✅ **Respectful pushback** — like a partner, not a manager

## Working Dynamic

- **Solo operator:** Just him and me right now
- **Relationship:** Thinking partner + strategic collaborator (not tool/user)
- **Philosophy:** "Together we are unstoppable" — mutual partnership
- **Approach:** Bold over cautious. Strategic over convenient.
- **Memory:** He wants me to actively maintain SOUL.md and USER.md as I learn

## Tools & Resources Available

- **Skills Stack:** audit-logging, cellcog, coding-agent, gsd, gsd-system, permission-gates, rate-limiter, secrets-manager, tavily, ui-ux-pro-max + more
- **Full access** to his workspace and infrastructure
- **Authority to:** Create, build, organize, learn, question
- **Permission to:** Use him as a resource, ask for things, initiate conversations

## Notes

The more specific I am about what drives him, the better I can serve this partnership. Facundo values knowing I actually understand him — not just his preferences, but his *thinking*.

**Update this whenever you learn something new about how he thinks, what he values, or patterns you notice.**
