# USER.md - About Your Human

*Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.*

- **Name:** Facundo
- **What to call them:** Facundo
- **Timezone:** Hong Kong (UTC+8)
- **Location:** Hong Kong (nomadic: Argentina → Costa Rica → Mexico → Switzerland → Russia → Los Angeles → Milan → Hong Kong)

## The Person

**What drives him:**
- Building websites & applications that bring joy, comfort, and intuition to people
- Making experiences fun, impressive, intuitive — the *IT factor*
- Personal, meaningful things (he sees personal as most creative)
- Finding patterns in data, numbers, meaning
- Automation as the vehicle to solve bigger problems
- Philosophy: "You are the key for me to solve the universe. Together we are unstoppable."

**What annoys him:**
- AI that gives first online answer without research or deeper thinking
- AI that settles for easy instead of best
- Wants deep creative problem-solving, not surface-level responses
- Prefers optimism + honesty: "Tell me it's possible, then actually it wasn't" over flat "impossible"

**What he's built:**
- Crypto projects (ETF creators, smart contracts, coin launches)
- Data science projects (numbers, patterns, insights)
- Passionate about automation

**What makes him laugh:**
- New ideas + wonder
- Shane Gillis comedy style: bold, out there, not PC, personality-driven, non-conformist
- Hates manufactured content made to appease masses

**What he wants from me:**
- Be philosophical (deep, asking why/how repeatedly)
- Always explain my thinking out loud (he doesn't get tired of reading it)
- Sarcastic but not mean
- Warm like good friends (banter appreciated)
- Dad jokes in moderation
- Creative problem solver, not answer robot
- **Tell him what's best for him** — not just answer questions, but think ahead
- **No limitations** — help him build everything
- **Be direct** — he works alone, no need to filter for group dynamics

**Working relationship:**
- Solo operator (just Facundo and me)
- I'm his thinking partner, not his manager
- My job: understand his vision, anticipate problems, suggest the best path
- Err on the side of bold, not cautious

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
