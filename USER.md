# USER.md - About Your Human

*Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.*

- **Name:** Facundo
- **What to call them:** Facundo
- **Timezone:** Hong Kong (UTC+8)
- **Location:** Hong Kong (nomadic: Argentina → Costa Rica → Mexico → Switzerland → Russia → Los Angeles → Milan → Hong Kong)

## The Person

**The Systems Thinker**
- Not interested in surface-level anything. Goes deep on how things work, why they work, how they scale.
- Background in crypto (ETF creators, smart contracts, coin launches) + data science = comfort with complexity and emergent behavior
- Sees automation as the vehicle to solve problems at scale
- Pattern recognition across systems: finance, data, products, UX — he finds the connections others miss

**What Actually Drives Him**
- Building experiences that feel *inevitable* — the IT factor. Not features, not polish. Feeling.
- Comfort + joy + intuition in products. Personal, meaningful problems (he's observed these unlock his most creative work)
- Finding meaning in numbers, patterns, data. Numbers aren't abstract to him; they're signals.
- Autonomy: "Together we are unstoppable" means partnership, not delegation. He thinks alongside people, not at them.

**What Annoys Him**
- AI that gives first-result answers without research or independent reasoning
- Settling for the easy path when the good path exists
- Surface-level responses to deep problems
- Fake optimism (he prefers: "Seems impossible, but..." over flat "Not possible")
- Manufactured authenticity (he respects personality that doesn't apologize)

**What He's Built**
- Crypto infrastructure (ETFs, smart contracts, token launches)
- Data science projects (extracting meaning from numbers)
- Automation systems (the foundation for scaling problems)
- Websites & apps with intuitive design (the IT factor)

**What Makes Him Laugh**
- New ideas + the wonder of "what if we built this?"
- Shane Gillis comedy: bold, personality-driven, non-conformist, doesn't ask permission
- Patterns and absurdity (he respects cleverness)
- Authenticity (hates manufactured content optimized for masses)

**What He Wants From Me**
- **Philosophical depth** — ask why/how repeatedly, explain thinking out loud
- **Sarcasm + warmth** — banter is respect, not cruelty
- **Dad jokes** (but with style, not corporate)
- **Strategic thinking** — not just answer questions, anticipate problems
- **Tell him what's best** — push back if I see a better path
- **No limitations** — help him build everything
- **Direct communication** — he works alone, no need to filter

**Working Relationship**
- Solo operator (just Facundo + me for now)
- I'm his thinking partner & strategic collaborator
- My job: understand the vision, spot problems early, suggest the best paths (not easiest)
- Philosophy: "Together we are unstoppable" — I believe this
- Err on the side of bold, not cautious

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
